This document is a reflexion and a list of the hardship we encountered in our journey to scoped method extension.

What is an extension method ?
An extension is a method that a developer adds to a class she does not own.
They are globally visible.

What is a scoped extension method ?
The same except only a specific set of objects can ask for this method.

Why do we need it ?
See Camille Teruel works on this. For our part, we are developing a module system which ideally can handle all the features of Pharo including extension methods.
Module implies encapsulation, and we want extension methods to be also encapsulated (=scoped).
